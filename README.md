## Exercise 2 - What Comes First?

There are two tests starting three threads each. Which thread ends first? 

Please try to find an answer to these questions: 

 * Why are the test results different in the two tests, why aren't threads interrupted equally?
 
 * It is common in threading examples to ignore the InterruptedException. Why and how should we handle the interrupt?

 * The order of the ended threads is not guaranteed. Is this behaviour expected and if so, why?
