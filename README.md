## B - What Comes First?

There are two tests starting three threads each. Which thread ends first? 

The classes tested differs slightly but ends with totally different result. Please try to find an answer to these questions: 

 * Why are the test results different, why aren't threads interrupted equally?
 
 * It is common in threading examples to ignore the InterruptedException. Why and how should we handle the interrupt?

 * The order of the ended threads is not guaranteed. Is this behaviour expected and so why?
